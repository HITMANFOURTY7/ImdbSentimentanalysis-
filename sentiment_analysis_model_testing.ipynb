It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no \\\"stars\\\" appeared in \\\"Ex Machina\\\" and \\\"Eva\\\", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.\",\n          \"Extraordinary and thought-provoking.\\n'Ex machina' is surprisingly dense, more so than other titles Alex Garland has written, perhaps excepting only 'Annihilation.' The simple concept is given a definite narrative, but that narrative pointedly explores the very nature of thought, and perception, and further broaching the nature and ramifications of morality. This is a psychological thriller, and in fundamental construction and in minute rendering alike, it is more intense than any other feature in the genre that I can name offhand, so much so as to almost classify as horror. The movie emphasizes and plays on dire uncertainty of intent, motivation, and reality all the way through to the climax, and even then leaves us with a somewhat ambiguous ending. And from ordinary beginning to captivating ending, at every point 'Ex machina' is absolutely marvelous.\\n\\nOf any performance I've seen from Oscar Isaac, none have been nearly so forceful as his portrayal of Nathan, exhibiting outstanding nuance and sharp personality in the realization of a man exceptionally intelligent, and exceptionally cruel and conniving. I'm not especially familiar with Domhnall Gleeson, but the Irish actor demonstrates admirable range and poise readily matching the same traits that are more immediately notable in his costars. And with that said - certainly not to count out anyone else involved - Alicia Vikander is phenomenal as Ava, showing a careful exactness to every motion and expression befitting the character, and impressing with her skills in the most subtle of ways.\\n\\nI love the score composed between Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow, lending to the pensive unease about the film and building to a great crescendo at the precise appropriate moments. The sound design is exquisite - soft and unobtrusive, and with those qualities denoting both the meticulous craft of the feature, and the highly advanced status of Ava. So it is, too, with the special effects; to read a little bit of the production history informs of the substantial effort made to ensure every element of Nathan's creation was visualized with the utmost possibility of realism. And I think that endeavor paid off handsomely.\\n\\nThe characters as written are wonderfully complex, and the dialogue deceptively so. Garland's scene writing is impeccable and deeply engrossing, to say nothing of the overall narrative that delves into such heavy subject matter. Even being aware of the acclaim the feature had garnered since its release, I wasn't wholly sure what to expect as I sat to watch. What I got far exceeded anything I had imagined, mostly stepping away significantly from the common story ideas that populate most sci-fi films about artificial intelligence. Garland's screenplay analyzes consciousness with depth, completeness, and potency that I wouldn't have anticipated from a genre picture, and the result is so terrifically engaging as to be exhilarating. Factor in sound performances and excellent music, and 'Ex machina' is a firmly first-rate slice of science fiction that I call a must-see.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"IMDb Rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no \\\"stars\\\" appeared in \\\"Ex Machina\\\" and \\\"Eva\\\", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.\",\n          \"Extraordinary and thought-provoking.\\n'Ex machina' is surprisingly dense, more so than other titles Alex Garland has written, perhaps excepting only 'Annihilation.' The simple concept is given a definite narrative, but that narrative pointedly explores the very nature of thought, and perception, and further broaching the nature and ramifications of morality. This is a psychological thriller, and in fundamental construction and in minute rendering alike, it is more intense than any other feature in the genre that I can name offhand, so much so as to almost classify as horror. The movie emphasizes and plays on dire uncertainty of intent, motivation, and reality all the way through to the climax, and even then leaves us with a somewhat ambiguous ending. And from ordinary beginning to captivating ending, at every point 'Ex machina' is absolutely marvelous.\\n\\nOf any performance I've seen from Oscar Isaac, none have been nearly so forceful as his portrayal of Nathan, exhibiting outstanding nuance and sharp personality in the realization of a man exceptionally intelligent, and exceptionally cruel and conniving. I'm not especially familiar with Domhnall Gleeson, but the Irish actor demonstrates admirable range and poise readily matching the same traits that are more immediately notable in his costars. And with that said - certainly not to count out anyone else involved - Alicia Vikander is phenomenal as Ava, showing a careful exactness to every motion and expression befitting the character, and impressing with her skills in the most subtle of ways.\\n\\nI love the score composed between Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow, lending to the pensive unease about the film and building to a great crescendo at the precise appropriate moments. The sound design is exquisite - soft and unobtrusive, and with those qualities denoting both the meticulous craft of the feature, and the highly advanced status of Ava. So it is, too, with the special effects; to read a little bit of the production history informs of the substantial effort made to ensure every element of Nathan's creation was visualized with the utmost possibility of realism. And I think that endeavor paid off handsomely.\\n\\nThe characters as written are wonderfully complex, and the dialogue deceptively so. Garland's scene writing is impeccable and deeply engrossing, to say nothing of the overall narrative that delves into such heavy subject matter. Even being aware of the acclaim the feature had garnered since its release, I wasn't wholly sure what to expect as I sat to watch. What I got far exceeded anything I had imagined, mostly stepping away significantly from the common story ideas that populate most sci-fi films about artificial intelligence. Garland's screenplay analyzes consciousness with depth, completeness, and potency that I wouldn't have anticipated from a genre picture, and the result is so terrifically engaging as to be exhilarating. Factor in sound performances and excellent music, and 'Ex machina' is a firmly first-rate slice of science fiction that I call a must-see.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"IMDb Rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no \\\"stars\\\" appeared in \\\"Ex Machina\\\" and \\\"Eva\\\", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.\",\n          \"Extraordinary and thought-provoking.\\n'Ex machina' is surprisingly dense, more so than other titles Alex Garland has written, perhaps excepting only 'Annihilation.' The simple concept is given a definite narrative, but that narrative pointedly explores the very nature of thought, and perception, and further broaching the nature and ramifications of morality. This is a psychological thriller, and in fundamental construction and in minute rendering alike, it is more intense than any other feature in the genre that I can name offhand, so much so as to almost classify as horror. The movie emphasizes and plays on dire uncertainty of intent, motivation, and reality all the way through to the climax, and even then leaves us with a somewhat ambiguous ending. And from ordinary beginning to captivating ending, at every point 'Ex machina' is absolutely marvelous.\\n\\nOf any performance I've seen from Oscar Isaac, none have been nearly so forceful as his portrayal of Nathan, exhibiting outstanding nuance and sharp personality in the realization of a man exceptionally intelligent, and exceptionally cruel and conniving. I'm not especially familiar with Domhnall Gleeson, but the Irish actor demonstrates admirable range and poise readily matching the same traits that are more immediately notable in his costars. And with that said - certainly not to count out anyone else involved - Alicia Vikander is phenomenal as Ava, showing a careful exactness to every motion and expression befitting the character, and impressing with her skills in the most subtle of ways.\\n\\nI love the score composed between Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow, lending to the pensive unease about the film and building to a great crescendo at the precise appropriate moments. The sound design is exquisite - soft and unobtrusive, and with those qualities denoting both the meticulous craft of the feature, and the highly advanced status of Ava. So it is, too, with the special effects; to read a little bit of the production history informs of the substantial effort made to ensure every element of Nathan's creation was visualized with the utmost possibility of realism. And I think that endeavor paid off handsomely.\\n\\nThe characters as written are wonderfully complex, and the dialogue deceptively so. Garland's scene writing is impeccable and deeply engrossing, to say nothing of the overall narrative that delves into such heavy subject matter. Even being aware of the acclaim the feature had garnered since its release, I wasn't wholly sure what to expect as I sat to watch. What I got far exceeded anything I had imagined, mostly stepping away significantly from the common story ideas that populate most sci-fi films about artificial intelligence. Garland's screenplay analyzes consciousness with depth, completeness, and potency that I wouldn't have anticipated from a genre picture, and the result is so terrifically engaging as to be exhilarating. Factor in sound performances and excellent music, and 'Ex machina' is a firmly first-rate slice of science fiction that I call a must-see.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"IMDb Rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Predicted Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2.9000000953674316,\n          0.20000000298023224\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no \\\"stars\\\" appeared in \\\"Ex Machina\\\" and \\\"Eva\\\", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.\",\n          \"Extraordinary and thought-provoking.\\n'Ex machina' is surprisingly dense, more so than other titles Alex Garland has written, perhaps excepting only 'Annihilation.' The simple concept is given a definite narrative, but that narrative pointedly explores the very nature of thought, and perception, and further broaching the nature and ramifications of morality. This is a psychological thriller, and in fundamental construction and in minute rendering alike, it is more intense than any other feature in the genre that I can name offhand, so much so as to almost classify as horror. The movie emphasizes and plays on dire uncertainty of intent, motivation, and reality all the way through to the climax, and even then leaves us with a somewhat ambiguous ending. And from ordinary beginning to captivating ending, at every point 'Ex machina' is absolutely marvelous.\\n\\nOf any performance I've seen from Oscar Isaac, none have been nearly so forceful as his portrayal of Nathan, exhibiting outstanding nuance and sharp personality in the realization of a man exceptionally intelligent, and exceptionally cruel and conniving. I'm not especially familiar with Domhnall Gleeson, but the Irish actor demonstrates admirable range and poise readily matching the same traits that are more immediately notable in his costars. And with that said - certainly not to count out anyone else involved - Alicia Vikander is phenomenal as Ava, showing a careful exactness to every motion and expression befitting the character, and impressing with her skills in the most subtle of ways.\\n\\nI love the score composed between Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow, lending to the pensive unease about the film and building to a great crescendo at the precise appropriate moments. The sound design is exquisite - soft and unobtrusive, and with those qualities denoting both the meticulous craft of the feature, and the highly advanced status of Ava. So it is, too, with the special effects; to read a little bit of the production history informs of the substantial effort made to ensure every element of Nathan's creation was visualized with the utmost possibility of realism. And I think that endeavor paid off handsomely.\\n\\nThe characters as written are wonderfully complex, and the dialogue deceptively so. Garland's scene writing is impeccable and deeply engrossing, to say nothing of the overall narrative that delves into such heavy subject matter. Even being aware of the acclaim the feature had garnered since its release, I wasn't wholly sure what to expect as I sat to watch. What I got far exceeded anything I had imagined, mostly stepping away significantly from the common story ideas that populate most sci-fi films about artificial intelligence. Garland's screenplay analyzes consciousness with depth, completeness, and potency that I wouldn't have anticipated from a genre picture, and the result is so terrifically engaging as to be exhilarating. Factor in sound performances and excellent music, and 'Ex machina' is a firmly first-rate slice of science fiction that I call a must-see.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"IMDb Rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Predicted Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2.9000000953674316,\n          0.20000000298023224\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Predicted Review Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Negative\",\n          \"Positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
